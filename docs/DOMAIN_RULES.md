# Domain rules and acceptance cases

Status: proposed. Read only the section relevant to the task. All sections inherit the tenant/access rules in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 1. Learners, guardians and early years

Admissions: enquiry/application → review → offered/waitlisted/declined → accepted → enrolled. An authorized admission creates the learner and dated enrolment atomically; it does not silently create a login or invoice. Check duplicates, school-unique admission numbers and capacity; an override needs a reason. Missing optional documents stay missing rather than being invented.

Keep multiple guardian links with verified academic/billing/pickup/contact rights. Do not require national identity documents or sensitive demographic fields without a documented purpose. Archive/transfer/withdraw learners through effective-dated records. Promotion previews next-year enrolments and preserves previous classes/reports; never increment a class number in place.

Nursery/KG observations capture date, educator, reviewed indicator/rubric and evidence. Report narrative progress, not a universal exam rank. Nursery care/development expectations require specialist review. Authorized collection records the verified collector, time and releasing staff; unexpected pickup goes to designated staff. Payment authority is not collection authority.

**Acceptance:** duplicate import/promotion replay creates no duplicate enrolment; a mid-term transfer preserves history; revoked/restricted guardians lose access; unauthorized pickup is blocked; a KG report has appropriate observations without inherited A1–F9 bands.

## 2. Attendance and follow-up

Roster derives from eligible enrolments and school-open dates. Register lifecycle: open/draft → submitted → locked. Marks: unmarked, present, late, absent, excused. Unmarked is never automatically absent. School policy defines late/excused treatment and denominator; exclude closures and dates outside enrolment.

Save with expected version and retry-safe operation ID. Submitted corrections need a reason; locked-period changes need a reviewer. Only confirmed submitted absence can start an absence notice. Staff review circumstances and contact authority; an explainable repeated-absence rule creates a follow-up task, not a permanent risk label.

Support loop: evidence → assigned action/owner → due date → reassessment → resolved/continuing/dismissed with reason. Do not claim a child's future outcome from attendance data.

**Acceptance:** save/reload agrees; concurrent edits conflict visibly; retries do not duplicate events; late admissions and closures produce correct denominators; corrected absence cancels/reviews a queued notice.

## 3. Curriculum, assessment and reports

Version curriculum by issuer/source, effective dates, level, learning area, strand/sub-strand and indicator. Preserve official codes where verified and distinguish local additions. Nursery, KG, Primary, JHS and future SHS require appropriate policies. A school-approved configuration is not automatically a national requirement.

Each assessment policy specifies components, maximum scores, weights, rubrics/bands, rounding, missing/exempt/retake rules, approvers and report template. Numeric contribution = earned/maximum × weight; weights sum to 100. An illustrative 40/60 split is not a Ghana-wide default. Use exact decimals and explicit boundary/tie rules. Missing, absent and exempt are distinct from zero; reweighting requires an explicit policy.

Keep internal reports, mock exams and official BECE/WASSCE results separate. Do not predict official grades with fixed percentage thresholds. Rankings are optional, off for early years by default, and require comparable cohorts/assessments. Averages use valid denominators rather than treating missing subjects as zero.

Workflow: draft → submitted → returned/approved → published → corrected version. Approval binds exact inputs; later edits invalidate it. Publication freezes identity/class, policy, scores/evidence, attendance and approvers. Corrections create a superseding snapshot. Guardians see only published records; teacher/AI comments need human review.

SHS seam: separate levels, curricula, calendars and subject offerings now; add pathways, individual subject enrolment, combinations and transcripts when commissioned. Revalidate current policy and exam formats. Adding three classes does not make the product SHS-ready.

**Acceptance:** policy changes leave old reports unchanged; missing marks remain explicit; out-of-scope teachers cannot edit; stale approvals cannot publish; reports preserve historical classes; AI remarks cite evidence and do not invent traits/diagnoses.

## 4. Fees, payments and reconciliation

Build an immutable operational fees subledger. It is not a full general ledger or payroll product. Label collections, outstanding fees, refunds, charges, settlements and cash/expense summaries accurately; do not present cash surplus as audited profit.

Version fee schedules, concessions and due installments. Preview billing scope/totals before posting. Draft invoices can be cancelled; posted amounts change through referenced credit/debit adjustments. Due installments partition the charge, not multiply it. Age only unpaid amounts already due, using a documented allocation order.

Use integer pesewas and server-issued unique receipt numbers. At a cutoff:

- Invoice due = posted charges + debit adjustments − credit adjustments − active allocations.
- Unallocated payment = accepted/verified amount − active allocations − completed refunds from unallocated funds.

Refunding allocated money requires releasing the allocation first; reserve pending refunds to prevent double use. Lock affected balances and enforce same-school references. Overpayment becomes unapplied credit; never silently allocate to a sibling. Reversals/refunds preserve history and need authorized reasons. Approval separation is school-configured, with explicit one-person exceptions where accepted. Closed-period records cannot be silently edited.

Cash requires named collector/receipt and cash reconciliation. Manual bank/MoMo evidence remains pending until authorized verification. Integrated payments require verified server-side provider facts matching merchant, reference, amount and currency. Browser success cannot mark fees paid. Store no card secrets or MoMo PINs.

Provider path: stable intent/reference → initiate outside DB transaction → verify signed webhook → durably deduplicate → map trusted merchant/reference to school → post once → reconcile settlement. Handle late success, missing/out-of-order callbacks, wrong amounts, refunds and uncertain states. Provider success and bank settlement are separate; reconcile gross receipts, provider charges and net settlement. Unknown events enter an exception queue.

Example: GHS 1,000 billed and GHS 600 allocated leaves GHS 400 due. Duplicate callback changes nothing. Refund GHS 100 without reducing the original charge: reverse that allocation and refund it; GHS 500 is now due. A reduced charge requires its own credit note.

School money settles through the school's approved merchant arrangement. SaaS subscriptions are separate. Select a regulated provider and validate commercial/settlement terms; no provider is selected yet.

**Acceptance:** exact statement reconciliation; no double posting after retries/crashes; concurrent allocations/refunds cannot overspend; fake callback/wrong merchant cannot change balances; imports reconcile opening totals; corrections preserve original entries.

## 5. Communication, staff and scheduling

Messages: draft → approved → queued → processing → delivered/failed/unknown/cancelled. Track recipient/channel attempts separately. Before approval show exact content, audience/exclusions, timing and cost. Changes invalidate approval. Recheck contact rights, permissions and underlying facts before dispatch; paid fees should not trigger stale debt reminders.

Provider-accepted is not delivered; delivered is not read. Use approved templates, quiet hours, contact preferences and applicable opt-outs. Automation requires explicit bounded configuration; AI cannot enable sending. Do not assume WhatsApp access or current provider rules. Direct government/WAEC integrations require authorized specifications; start with reviewed exports only when formats are confirmed.

Staff employment records are separate from login roles. Teaching assignments are effective-dated. Timetable draft → conflict validation → published version; reject overlapping teacher/class/room bookings. Start with manual scheduling, not the demo's solver.

**Acceptance:** recipient rights revoked while queued prevent delivery; stale notices are reviewed/cancelled; retries do not blindly resend uncertain operations; teacher/class/room conflicts are visible; no unauthorized staff detail leaks through search or exports.

## 6. Definition of done for a feature

Record scope, invariants and acceptance cases before coding. Include success, denied access, invalid input, stale/concurrent write and retry behavior. Verify the actual runtime DB role and at least two schools for data changes; UI-only guards are insufficient. Verify a real click and persisted visible result for interactions, including mobile/keyboard where applicable.

Handoff: exact changed files, checks/results, mocked or unverified dependencies and next action. A first live pilot additionally needs academic/finance sign-off, provider acceptance, current privacy/legal arrangements, restore evidence and school-user acceptance. No unresolved critical isolation, financial-integrity or unapproved-AI-action failures may pass that gate.
